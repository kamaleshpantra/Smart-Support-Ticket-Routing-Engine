# Smart-Support-Ticket-Routing-Engine
An end-to-end ticket routing engine built to reduce manual support triage. It processes incoming tickets through an API, assigns categories such as billing or technical issues, detects urgency, and queues requests for downstream handling. Designed to be simple, extensible, and resilient under load.
